//Admin creating a team and adding themself to it as well as inviting some player
A user tries to log in by providing their username and password, which are verified by the system. The player logs in successfully.
The user then tries to set up a team, and provides a name for the new team. The user is
now an admin for the team. The admin invites themself to the team, and accepts their own
invitation. The team now has the user as both a player and an admin for the team.
