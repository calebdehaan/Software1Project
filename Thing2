//Admin creating a team and adding themself to it as well as inviting some player
A user tries to log in, provides username and password, and logs in successfully.
The user then tries to set up a team, and provides a name for the new team. The user is
now an admin for the team. The admin invites themself to the team, and accepts their own
invitation. The team now has the user as both a player and an admin for the team.
