//Player accepting invite to team and checking stats on team
A player opens up the app. The player tries to log in by providing a username and password which are validated by the system.
If the player logs in successfully, they can accept an invite to a team and the system adds them
to the team. The player can now open up the team page. The player opens up the
statistics for the team, reads them, and then logs off the system.
